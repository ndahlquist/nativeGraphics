A simple cross-compilation setup for Android and Linux. The 'android' and 'linux'
directories contain build files for their respective platforms, which call the 
code in the 'common' directory through the 'common.h' api.

Based on source code from LibST, the Android Open Source Project, and Stanford CS148 starter project code.
