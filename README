A simple cross-compilation setup for Android, iOS and Linux.
The 'android', 'ios and 'linux' directories contain build files for their
respective platforms, which call the code in the 'common' directory through
the 'common.h' api.

Based on source code from the Android Open Source Project, and Stanford CS148
starter project code.
